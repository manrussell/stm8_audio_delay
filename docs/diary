==========
So Spi traces look weird.
make sure everthing is connected properly..

now is a good time to fix up the tests, if they work, then HW set up should be ok.

-> How do i want the tests to run?
  -> reflash for each test? hmmmm :( might have to though for manual tests... checking with Oscilloscope
    -> button and led to display test success and button to progress to next test??

Review...

   
ToDo.
*)
Wire in test button, HW debunce?
Wire in extInt pin ... 
    Pull extInt pin high using pull up internal pull up?
    Hw pulls pin low?
  GPIO_MODE_IN_PU_IT         = (uint8_t)0x60,  /*!< Input pull-up, external interrupt */


*)
SPI needs fixing, weird MISO -> is this just logic analyser effecting signal?
why no MISO?

*)
DAC do i send a message over spi taking my time, and then toggle latch pin using the timer? more accurate doodah. 

*)
Do the tests work?
-> ( Does the button work )
How do they work?
    1 test upon fail get stuck in while loop
    some tests require human interaction to exit
    -> this requires button press,
    --> exch functio set a variable true, then interrupt setd it false
    eg while( testIncomplete ) ... until extirq
    --> this is ... hmmmm 
*)
disable interrupts between tests

*)
What gpio's do i need / want?
re-do requirements.


    // is this used anymore?
    #define LED_port                    GPIOD
    #define LED_pin                     GPIO_PIN_4

    // test pin
    // rename timing debug pin?
    // init by GPIO_setupDebugPin( );
    #define TEST_port                   GPIOC
    #define TEST_pin                    GPIO_PIN_3

    //below untested ...
    #define NEXT_TEST_BUTTON_PORT       GPIOC
    #define NEXT_TEST_BUTTON_PIN        GPIO_PIN_1

review out come.
    .led is not used
    .rename TEST_port/pin to timing_debugPin
    .which is the extInt pin? -> will this cause conflict
    .ADC's ?

**)
Some kinda big DEINIT( ) between tests ,, or

Could i do a software reset?
    on HW reset clear a variable
    on SW reset keep a variable,
    if soft reset skip tests?
    What register says if soft reset?
    --> maybe hold button to enter tests?

*)    
done RAM and DAC
    re-define the functions names to remove specific component names in test functions

*)
update freq of TIM2_UPD_IRQHandler( )
this should be 11025Hz * 10 , for state machine


*)
Documentation / website


*)
what about that delay_us( 1 ) in spi for CS pin?
Do the flags work? 

*)
GPIO_setupDebugPin( );
    /* Used to time functions using a logic ananylser. */
    void GPIO_setupDebugPin( void )
    {
        //GPIO_Init( LED_port, LED_pin, GPIO_MODE_OUT_PP_HIGH_FAST );
        GPIO_Init( TEST_port, TEST_pin, GPIO_MODE_OUT_PP_HIGH_FAST );
    }

 whats going on? this is sometmes uesd, do i even need it now? -> test buttton extInt 

*)
Almost done.
Some code is snake case some code is camel case, use camel case

*)
mcli ...
