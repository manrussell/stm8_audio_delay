software
========
========

sine table, so i can by pass microphone ( microphone needs a quieter power supply.

example to use adc to sample more knobs. multi channel
->don't use just one adc reading take a few and average them?

timer for event driven stuff, 45, ms
-> one for driving signal adc/dac,
-> one for reading adc potentiometers

mixing signals root two?

feedback algorithm.
-> multitap
-> variable length


hardware
========
========

more knobs

buffer for output.
line level input.
CV input





====
sine table

max freq = 11025Hz
low freq = 100Hz


A  = 1, further amp change can be done in software
pi = 3.141
f  = 100. maybe if 
T  = Time period of 1 period, Seconds? - we only need one cycle, so T = 1/f = 1/100 = 0.01
t  = sample rate, 11KHz = 1/11000 = 0.090

sineTable = A * sin( 2 * pi * f * t/T);


How much ram will that take?
do i leave it in flash or bung in ram? How much ram am i using?
stack size 
heap

flash size
